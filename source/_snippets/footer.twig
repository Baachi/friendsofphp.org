                <h3>Why Map of Events?</h3>

                <p>Go out, <strong>meet new people, share your ideas in another country</strong> and grow. You'll be surprised how valuable feedback you can get on meetups abroad and how easy is to get your talk there. Pick meetup, write the organizer and go!</p>

                <br>

                <h3>How This Works?</h3>

                <p>
                    This website is <strong>regenerated by Travis and Github every 24 hours</strong>, so meetups are fresh as they can be.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We show <strong>meetups for next {{ max_forecast_days }} days</strong>, so you can pick up where to go speak or watch without being overwhelmed.
