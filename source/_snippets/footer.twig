        <h3>How This Works?</h3>

        <p>
            This website is <strong>regenerated by Travis and Github every 24 hours</strong>, so meetups are fresh as they can be.
        </p>

        <p>
            We show <strong>meetups for next {{ max_forecast_days }} days</strong>, so you can pick up where to go speak or watch without being overwhelmed.

        <p>
            Meeting people from other countries brings <strong>fresh energy to your coding</strong>, new ideas and valuable feedback.
